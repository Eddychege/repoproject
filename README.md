# KCSE Performance Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of KCSE performance for the years 2023 and 2024.

## Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of students in the KCSE exams for the years 2023 and 2024, focusing on grade distributions, gender disparities, and potential trends.

## Data
- `data_2023`: Contains the data for KCSE 2023.
- `data_2024`: Contains the data for KCSE 2024.
-  all the data was obtained from newspaper articles

## Visualizations
- `Grade_Distribution_2023.png`: Grade distribution for KCSE 2023.
- `Grade_Distribution_2024.png`: Grade distribution for KCSE 2024.
- `Gender_Distribution_2023.png`: Gender distribution for KCSE 2023.
- `Gender_Distribution_2024.png`: Gender distribution for KCSE 2024.

## Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python and includes:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes the key statistics for each year.
2. **Grade Distribution Visualization**: Visualizes the distribution of grades for each year.
3. **Gender Distribution Visualization**: Compares the performance of male and female students.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Visualizes the trends in grades over the two years.
5. **Statistical Testing**: Conducts chi-squared tests to see if differences are significant.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that while there are minor variations in grade distributions, these differences are not statistically significant. This implies that the exams have maintained a consistent level of difficulty across the two years.

## Future Directions
Further research could explore:
- Socio-economic factors influencing performance.
- School resources and their impact on student outcomes.
